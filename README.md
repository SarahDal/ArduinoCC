# ArduinoCC
Arduino Car Counter

A rubber tube connected to a pressure sensor. Cars travelling over the tubing change the pressure, which is then recorded by the arduino.

pressure_test.ino can be used to calibrate the pressure readings

PressureMonitorImp.ino registers cars travelling over the rubber tube, and writes the time and date of each trigger to a microSD card
